## üéØ **HOW TO USE**

### **In Web App:**

1. Look for **blue chatbot icon** in bottom-right corner
2. Click to open chat
3. Ask questions like:
   - "How many workers do we have?"
   - "Who are the top performers?"
   - "What's the assignment success rate?"
   - "Show me workers with low fatigue"

### **Suggested Questions:**
- General: "Help me understand the system"
- Workers: "Who are my best workers?"
- Performance: "Show me performance statistics"
- Assignments: "What's our success rate?"
- Health: "Which workers need rest?"

---

## üß† **DYNAMIC ML TRAINING**

### **How It Works:**

1. **No Pre-Training Needed:**
   - System uses heuristic scores initially
   - Starts learning from first 5 assignments

2. **Automatic Training:**
   - Triggers when enough data is available
   - Updates model incrementally
   - Improves with each assignment

3. **API Endpoints:**

```bash
# Check ML status
GET /ml/status

# Train model manually
POST /ml/train?incremental=true

# Get model info
GET /ml/status
```

### **Training Process:**

```
1. Supervisor assigns worker to role
2. Worker completes task
3. Assignment marked as success/failure
4. ML model learns from this data
5. Future recommendations improve
```

User: How many workers do we have?
Bot: We currently have 50 workers in the system.

User: Who are the top performers?
Bot: Top performing workers:
1. Priya Sharma - 92% performance
2. Neha Gupta - 91% performance
3. Sunita Reddy - 90% performance
```

### **Example 2: Assignment Query**

```
User: What's our assignment success rate?

## üöÄ **ADVANCED USAGE**

### **Load Full LLM (Optional):**

The chatbot works with rule-based responses by default. To use the full Hugging Face LLM:

```bash
# Via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chatbot/load

# Or uncomment in main.py startup:
# chatbot.load_model()
```

**Note:** First-time load takes ~30 seconds and ~1GB memory.

### **Manual Training:**

```bash
# Full training
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ml/train?incremental=false"

# Incremental training  
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ml/train?incremental=true"
```

### **Check Status:**

```bash
# ML Model
curl http://localhost:8000/ml/status

# Chatbot
curl http://localhost:8000/chatbot/status
```
