   - etc.
3. Click "Assign to Role" on Rajesh Kumar
4. Alert shows: ✅ SUCCESS! Worker: Rajesh Kumar, Role: Assembly Line Operator

### In Mobile App (within 2 seconds):

- Title: "New Role Assignment: Assembly Line Operator"
- Description: "You have been assigned to the role of Assembly Line Operator. Fit score: 92%. Please check the role requirements and start your tasks."

## 🔍 BACKEND LOGS

Check the backend terminal for detailed logs:

```
[DASHBOARD] ======================================
[DASHBOARD] ASSIGNING WORKER TO ROLE
[DASHBOARD] ======================================
[DASHBOARD] Worker: Rajesh Kumar (ID: 1)
[DASHBOARD] Role: Assembly Line Operator (ID: 1)

[DASHBOARD] ✅ Assignment created
[DASHBOARD] 📱 Creating task for mobile app...

[DASHBOARD] 🎉 Mobile app will show this task within 2 seconds!
[DASHBOARD] ======================================
[DASHBOARD] ASSIGNMENT COMPLETE!
[DASHBOARD] Check mobile app for the new task!
[DASHBOARD] ======================================
```

And then:
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "POST /assignment/create HTTP/1.1" 201 Created
INFO: 127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "POST /task/create HTTP/1.1" 201 Created

The last line is the mobile app fetching the new task!

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

**Issue: Task doesn't appear in mobile**

1. ✅ Check you're on the **Tasks tab** (not Profile, Notifications, etc.)
2. ✅ Wait 2 seconds (auto-refresh interval)
3. ✅ Check if worker ID is 1 (Rajesh Kumar) - mobile app shows Worker ID 1 tasks
4. ✅ Check backend logs for "POST /task/create" - should be 201 Created
5. ✅ Check browser console (F12) for mobile app errors

**Issue: "Find Best Workers" shows no recommendations**

1. ✅ Ensure workers exist in database (Dashboard should show "Total Workers: X")
2. ✅ Workers must have skills matching the role
3. ✅ Check backend logs for ML model errors
