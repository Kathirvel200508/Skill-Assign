# üéâ Analytics & ML Enhancements Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Enhancements

### 1. **Hours-Based Fatigue System** ‚è∞
**Replaced fatigue level with actual work hours tracking**

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `hours_per_day` (max 8.5) and `hours_per_week` (max 52) fields to Worker model
- Fatigue automatically calculated: `(hours_per_week/52)*0.7 + (hours_per_day/8.5)*0.3`
- Color-coded indicators:
  - üü¢ Green: < 45 hours/week
  - üü° Yellow: 45-50 hours/week  
  - üî¥ Red: 50+ hours/week (approaching max)

#### Frontend Changes:
- Worker forms now input hours instead of fatigue
- Dashboard shows hours per day and week with color coding
- Workers page displays work hour chips with status colors

#### Algorithm:
1. Analyzes all required skills across roles
2. Identifies missing skills per worker
3. Prioritizes based on:
   - Worker performance score
   - Current workload (hours/week)
   - Skill demand across roles
4. Recommends top 3 most in-demand missing skills

---

#### Example:
```
Assembly Line Operator
Description: Assemble automotive components on production line with precision
Tasks:
  - Assemble parts according to specifications
  - Perform quality checks
  - Package finished products
Success: Meet daily production targets with <2% defect rate
```

---

### 6. **Most In-Demand Skills Widget** üî•
**Shows which skills are needed most**

- **Location**: Analytics page
- **Data**: Skills ranked by number of roles requiring them
- **Purpose**: Guide training priorities and hiring decisions

---
