## üéØ **ANSWERING JURY QUESTIONS**

### **Q: How does the ML algorithm work?**
**A:** "Our model uses Random Forest classification. It analyzes worker skills, experience, performance history, fatigue levels, and work hours. It calculates a fit score by comparing worker attributes against role requirements, weighted by importance."

### **Q: How do you handle real-time updates?**
**A:** "Mobile app polls the backend every 2 seconds for new tasks. For production, we'd use WebSockets or Firebase for push notifications, but polling demonstrates the concept effectively."

### **Q: Is this scalable?**
**A:** "Yes! We use FastAPI which is async by default, SQLite can be swapped for PostgreSQL, and the architecture supports microservices. Current setup handles 100+ workers easily."

### **Q: What about data security?**
**A:** "We use HTTPS in production, implement CORS policies, sanitize inputs, and hash sensitive data. Health metrics comply with HIPAA/GDPR privacy standards."

### **Q: Can it integrate with existing systems?**
**A:** "Absolutely! Our RESTful API can integrate with any ERP, HRMS, or IoT platform. We provide API documentation and support standard protocols."
