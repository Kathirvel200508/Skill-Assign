# 🔧 QUICK FIX: Task Sync Not Working

## ✅ I've Added a Diagnostic Tool!

### **Open the Mobile App NOW**

1. Go to: **http://localhost:8082**
2. Look at the **bottom navigation tabs**
3. Click the **stethoscope icon** (Diagnostic tab) - **NEW!**

### **What You'll See:**

The Diagnostic screen will show you:
- ✅ Backend connection status
- ✅ Number of workers in database
- ✅ Number of tasks for Worker 1
- ✅ Real-time activity logs
- ✅ Error messages (if any)

### **Quick Test Button:**

Click the **"🧪 Create Test Task"** button on the Diagnostic screen.

This will:
1. Create a task directly from the mobile app
2. Show you if the API is working
3. Tell you to go to the Tasks tab

Then:
1. Click **Tasks tab** (bottom navigation)
2. You should see the new task **immediately!**

## 🐛 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: "Backend Disconnected"

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check if backend is running
# Should see: INFO: Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

If not running:
```bash
cd c:\Users\kavin\Skill-Assign\backend
.\run.bat
```

### Issue 2: "0 Tasks Found"

This is NORMAL if:
- No tasks have been created yet
- Tasks were assigned to a different worker (not Rajesh Kumar/Worker ID 1)

**Fix:** Create a test task from the Diagnostic screen

### Issue 3: "Web app doesn't create tasks in mobile"

**Checklist:**
1. ✅ Is backend running? (Check Diagnostic screen)
2. ✅ Is mobile app on Tasks tab? (Not Diagnostic)
3. ✅ Did you select "Rajesh Kumar" in web app? (Worker ID 1)
4. ✅ Wait 2 seconds after clicking "Assign Task"

### Issue 4: "CORS Error" or "Network Error"

The mobile app is running on http://localhost:8082
The backend is running on http://localhost:8000

These are different ports. If you see CORS errors:

**Check backend logs** - You should see:
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "GET /task/worker/1 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

If you DON'T see these logs = Mobile app can't reach backend

**Fix:** Both apps must use `localhost` (not 127.0.0.1)

## 📊 Expected Diagnostic Screen Output

```
Connection Status
Backend URL: http://localhost:8000
Backend: ✅ Connected
Workers: 20
Tasks (Worker 1): 8

Activity Log
12:55:30 PM  Running diagnostics...
12:55:30 PM  ✅ Backend OK: 20 workers found
12:55:30 PM  ✅ Tasks OK: 8 tasks for Worker 1
12:55:30 PM  Latest task: "TEST - Check Mobile Now!" (pending)
```

## 🎯 STEP-BY-STEP TEST (After Mobile App Reloads)

### **On Mobile App (http://localhost:8082):**

1. Open Diagnostic tab (stethoscope icon)
2. Check that Backend shows "✅ Connected"
3. Note the current task count (e.g., "Tasks: 8")
4. Click "🧪 Create Test Task" button
5. See alert: "Task created with ID: X"
6. Click **Tasks tab** (clipboard icon)
7. **NEW TASK SHOULD BE THERE!** ✅

### **Then Test From Web App:**

1. Keep mobile app on **Tasks tab** (IMPORTANT!)
2. Open web app: http://localhost:3000
3. Go to Tasks section
4. Click "Assign New Task"
5. Select "Rajesh Kumar" (Worker ID 1)
6. Fill in: "Web Test Task"
7. Click "Assign Task"
8. **Watch mobile app** - within 2 seconds, task appears!

## 💡 Why It Might Not Be Working

The most common reason: **You're not on the Tasks tab in the mobile app**

The Tasks screen has auto-refresh every 2 seconds.
Other screens (Profile, Notifications, etc.) do NOT auto-refresh.

**Solution:** Always be on the **Tasks tab** (clipboard icon) when testing!

---

## 🚀 Final Verification

Run this Python script to create a task:
```bash
python test_task_sync.py
```

Then **immediately** go to mobile app Tasks tab.
You should see the new task within 2 seconds!
