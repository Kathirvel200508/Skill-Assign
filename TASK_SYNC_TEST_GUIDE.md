# üî• REAL-TIME TASK SYNCHRONIZATION TEST GUIDE

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Testing Instructions

### **STEP 1: Open Both Apps Side by Side**

1. **Web Supervisor App**
   - Open: http://localhost:3000
   - Navigate to: **Tasks** section (in sidebar)

2. **Mobile App**  
   - Open: http://localhost:8082
   - Make sure you're on the **"Tasks"** tab (clipboard icon at bottom)
   - You should see: "My Tasks - Rajesh Kumar"

---

### **STEP 2: Verify Mobile App is Polling**

Check the **backend terminal** - you should see these logs repeating every 2 seconds:
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "GET /task/worker/1 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

‚úÖ If you see this = Mobile app is successfully polling for tasks!

---

### **STEP 3: Assign a Task from Web App**

In the **Web Supervisor App**:

1. Click **"Assign New Task"** button (top right)
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Worker:** Select "Rajesh Kumar" (or any worker with ID 1)
   - **Title:** "TEST - Check Mobile Now!"
   - **Description:** "Testing real-time sync"
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Due Date:** (optional)
3. Click **"Assign Task"** button

---

### **STEP 4: Watch the Mobile App**

Within **2 seconds**, you should see in the Mobile App:

‚úÖ **Green banner appears:** "üéâ New Task Assigned!"
‚úÖ **New task card appears** in the "üìã Pending Tasks" section
‚úÖ **Task counter updates** (e.g., "8 tasks" ‚Üí "9 tasks")

---

### **STEP 5: Verify in Backend Logs**

Check backend terminal - you should see:
```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "POST /task/create HTTP/1.1" 201 Created
INFO: 127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "GET /task/worker/1 HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

First line = Task created by web app
Second line = Mobile app fetched the new task

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Task doesn't appear in mobile app"

**Check #1: Is mobile app on the Tasks screen?**
- Look at bottom navigation tabs
- Tap the **clipboard icon** (Tasks tab)

**Check #2: Is mobile app actually running?**
- Go to http://localhost:8082
- You should see the app interface, not a blank page

**Check #3: Is mobile app polling?**
- Check backend logs for: `GET /task/worker/1`
- Should repeat every 2 seconds

**Check #4: Is the task assigned to Worker ID 1?**
- In web app, make sure you select **Rajesh Kumar** (Worker ID 1)
- Mobile app only shows tasks for Worker ID 1

**Check #5: Check browser console**
- Open mobile app (http://localhost:8082)
- Press F12 to open console
- Look for: `[MOBILE APP] ‚úÖ Tasks loaded`
