  }'
# Expected: 201 Created with worker object
```

**Get All Workers:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/worker/all
# Expected: Array of workers
```

**Update Worker:**
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/worker/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"fatigue_level": 0.2}'
# Expected: Updated worker object
```

**Delete Worker:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/worker/11
# Expected: 204 No Content
```

#### 3. Test Role CRUD

**Create Role:**

## ðŸ§  ML Model Testing

### Test Heuristic Scoring

**Before Training (< 10 samples):**

```bash
# Should use heuristic scoring
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict-fit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role_id": 1, "top_n": 3}'

# Verify:
# - Fit scores are between 0-1
# - Workers with matching skills score higher
# - Low fatigue workers score higher
# - High performance workers score higher
```

### Test Model Training

**Add Training Data:**

```bash
# Create 10+ assignments with feedback
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/assignment/create \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{\"worker_id\": $((i % 10 + 1)), \"role_id\": $((i % 6 + 1)), \"fit_score\": 0.8}"
  
  curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/assignment/$i/feedback \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"success": true}'
done
```

**Train Model:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/train-model

# Verify response includes:
# - status: "success"
# - metrics.mse (should be < 0.2)
# - metrics.r2 (should be > 0.5)
# - training_samples >= 10
```

### Test Model Predictions

**After Training:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict-fit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role_id": 1, "top_n": 5}'

# Verify:
# - Predictions use trained model
# - Fit scores are reasonable (0-1)
# - Confidence scores are present
# - Top workers have higher scores
```

### Test Model Persistence

**Restart Backend:**

```bash
# Stop and restart backend
# Model should auto-load from models/fit_model.pkl

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict-fit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role_id": 1, "top_n": 3}'

# Verify predictions still work
```

### Feature Extraction Testing

**Test Edge Cases:**

1. **Worker with no skills:**
   - Create worker with empty skills array
   - Get predictions
   - Verify low fit scores

2. **Role with no required skills:**
   - Create role with empty required_skills
   - Get predictions
   - Verify handling

3. **High fatigue worker:**
   - Create worker with fatigue_level = 0.9
   - Get predictions
   - Verify lower fit scores

4. **Perfect skill match:**
   - Create worker with exact skills as role
   - Get predictions
   - Verify high fit score

    "experience": 5,
    "skills": ["welding", "assembly"],
    "fatigue_level": 0.2,
    "performance_score": 0.85

  -d "{
    \"worker_id\": $WORKER_ID,
    \"role_id\": 1,
    \"fit_score\": 0.85
  }" | jq -r '.id')

# 4. Add feedback
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8000/assignment/$ASSIGNMENT_ID/feedback \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"success": true, "feedback": "Excellent performance"}'

# 5. Verify analytics updated

curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8000/worker/$WORKER_ID
```

### End-to-End Workflow 2: Model Retraining

```bash
# 1. Get initial predictions
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict-fit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role_id": 1, "top_n": 3}' > before.json

# 2. Add multiple assignments with feedback
# (Add 5+ new assignments)

# 3. Retrain model
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/train-model

# 4. Get new predictions
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict-fit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role_id": 1, "top_n": 3}' > after.json

# 5. Compare predictions
diff before.json after.json
```

## âš¡ Performance Testing

### Load Testing

**Test Concurrent Requests:**

```bash
# Install Apache Bench
# Windows: Download from Apache website
# Mac: brew install httpd
# Linux: sudo apt-get install apache2-utils

# Test worker endpoint
ab -n 100 -c 10 http://localhost:8000/worker/all

# Test prediction endpoint
ab -n 50 -c 5 -p predict.json -T application/json \
  http://localhost:8000/predict-fit

# Verify:
# - Requests per second > 50
# - No failed requests
# - Average response time < 200ms
```

### Database Performance

```bash
# Test with large dataset
# Add 100 workers
for i in {1..100}; do
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/worker/add \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d "{
      \"name\": \"Worker $i\",
      \"age\": $((20 + i % 40)),
      \"experience\": $((i % 15)),
      \"skills\": [\"skill1\", \"skill2\"],
      \"fatigue_level\": 0.3,
      \"performance_score\": 0.75
    }"
done

# Test query performance
time curl http://localhost:8000/worker/all
# Should complete in < 1 second
```

### ML Model Performance

```bash
# Test prediction speed
time curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict-fit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"role_id": 1, "top_n": 10}'

# With 100 workers, should complete in < 2 seconds
```
