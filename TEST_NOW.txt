====================================================================
🚀 TEST SUPERVISOR DASHBOARD → RAJESH KUMAR MOBILE APP
====================================================================

I've added extensive logging to see EXACTLY what's happening.

STEP-BY-STEP TEST:
==================

1. RESTART WEB DASHBOARD:
   - Go to terminal running web dashboard
   - Press Ctrl + C to stop
   - Run: npm run dev
   - Wait for "Local: http://localhost:3000"

2. OPEN SUPERVISOR DASHBOARD:
   - Go to: http://localhost:3000/tasks
   - Press F12 to open browser console
   - Keep console open!

3. OPEN MOBILE APP (in another tab):
   - Go to your mobile app URL
   - Press F12 to open console
   - Keep both consoles visible

4. ASSIGN A TASK:
   - In supervisor dashboard, click "Assign New Task"
   - Console will show: [SUPERVISOR] "Assign New Task" button clicked
   - Select "Rajesh Kumar" from worker dropdown
   - Enter task title: "TEST URGENT TASK"
   - Click "Assign Task" button

5. WATCH THE CONSOLE:

   SUPERVISOR CONSOLE WILL SHOW:
   ==============================
   [SUPERVISOR] ========================================
   [SUPERVISOR] ASSIGN TASK BUTTON CLICKED!
   [SUPERVISOR] ========================================
   [SUPERVISOR] Current form data: {...}
   [SUPERVISOR] ✅ Validation passed
   [SUPERVISOR] 📤 Sending task to backend...
   [SUPERVISOR] Task data: {...}
   [SUPERVISOR] 🎉🎉🎉 SUCCESS! 🎉🎉🎉
   [SUPERVISOR] Task ID: X
   [SUPERVISOR] Worker ID: 1
   [SUPERVISOR] Assigned to: Rajesh Kumar
   [SUPERVISOR] ========================================

   MOBILE APP CONSOLE WILL SHOW (within 2 seconds):
   =================================================
   [MOBILE APP] Auto-checking for new tasks...
   [MOBILE APP] ✅ Tasks loaded: X tasks for Rajesh Kumar
   [MOBILE APP] 🎉🎉🎉 1 NEW TASK(S) ASSIGNED FROM SUPERVISOR!
   [MOBILE APP] New task title: TEST URGENT TASK

6. YOU'LL SEE:
   - Alert popup: "✅ TASK ASSIGNED!"
   - Mobile app: Green banner "🎉 New Task Assigned!"
   - Mobile app: Task appears in list

IF IT DOESN'T WORK:
===================

Look at the SUPERVISOR console:

❌ If you see: [SUPERVISOR] ❌ VALIDATION FAILED
   → You didn't select a worker or enter a title
   → Make sure both fields are filled

❌ If you see: [SUPERVISOR] ❌❌❌ ERROR ❌❌❌
   → Backend is not running or not accessible
   → Check if http://localhost:8000/health works
   → Restart backend: cd backend && python -m uvicorn main:app --reload

❌ If you see nothing in console at all:
   → Button not being clicked
   → JavaScript error preventing execution
   → Look for red errors in console
   → Make sure you restarted the web dashboard

✅ If you see SUCCESS in supervisor but nothing in mobile app:
   → Mobile app not checking correctly
   → Check mobile app console for errors
   → Make sure mobile app API_BASE_URL is correct (localhost:8000)

SEND ME THE CONSOLE OUTPUT:
===========================

Copy and paste what you see in BOTH consoles:
1. Supervisor dashboard console
2. Mobile app console

This will show me EXACTLY where the problem is!
