# ü§ñ UserLM-8b CHATBOT INTEGRATION

## ‚úÖ **UPDATED TO MICROSOFT USERLM-8b**

The chatbot now uses Microsoft's advanced UserLM-8b model with your exact API specifications!

---

## üîß **WHAT WAS CHANGED**

### **1. Model Upgrade:**
- **Old:** DialoGPT-medium (345M parameters)
- **New:** Microsoft UserLM-8b (8 billion parameters)
- **Benefit:** Much more intelligent and context-aware responses

### **2. API Call Format:**
Implemented your exact API specification:

```python
# Create conversation with system prompt
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "{comprehensive_workforce_data}"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "{user_question}"}
]

# Apply chat template
inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

# Define end tokens
end_token = "<|eot_id|>"
end_token_id = tokenizer.encode(end_token, add_special_tokens=False)

end_conv_token = "<|endconversation|>"
end_conv_token_id = tokenizer.encode(end_conv_token, add_special_tokens=False)

# Generate with specific parameters
outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids=inputs,
    do_sample=True,
    top_p=0.8,
    temperature=1,
    max_new_tokens=300,
    eos_token_id=end_token_id,
    pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id,
    bad_words_ids=[[token_id] for token_id in end_conv_token_id]
)
```

### **3. Comprehensive Data Prefixing:**
Every prompt is now prefixed with complete workforce data:

**System Prompt Includes:**
- ‚úÖ All worker statistics (50 workers)
- ‚úÖ Top 5 performers with full details
- ‚úÖ Fatigue level breakdowns
- ‚úÖ All 25 roles with requirements
- ‚úÖ Task statistics (completed, in progress, pending)
- ‚úÖ Assignment success rates
- ‚úÖ Recent assignment history
- ‚úÖ System capabilities description

**Example System Prompt:**
```
WORKFORCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - COMPLETE DATA OVERVIEW

=== WORKERS DATABASE (50 Total) ===
- Average Performance Score: 87.2%
- High Performers (>85%): 15 workers
- Low Fatigue Workers (<30%): 35 workers  
- High Fatigue Workers (‚â•70%): 3 workers

Top 5 Performers:
1. Priya Sharma - Performance: 92%, Experience: 8.0 years, Fatigue: 20%, Skills: 5
2. Neha Gupta - Performance: 91%, Experience: 4.5 years, Fatigue: 18%, Skills: 5
...

=== ROLES DATABASE (25 Total) ===
Available roles with requirements:
- CNC Machine Operator: Difficulty 7.5/10, Required Skills: CNC Operation, Blueprint Reading...
...

=== SYSTEM CAPABILITIES ===
This is an AI-powered workforce management system that:
1. Uses ML algorithms to recommend best worker-role matches
2. Monitors worker health and fatigue in real-time
...

You are an AI assistant with access to all this data.
```

## üöÄ **SETUP**

### **Option 1: Load Model on Startup (Recommended for Production)**

Edit `backend/main.py` line 40:

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    ml_model.load()
    print("ML model loaded (if available)")
    
    # Load chatbot on startup
    chatbot.load_model()  # Uncomment this line
    print("Chatbot ready")
```

### **Option 2: Load via API (On-Demand)**

```bash
# Load model when needed
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chatbot/load
```

### **Hardware Requirements:**

**For CUDA/GPU (Recommended):**
- NVIDIA GPU with 8GB+ VRAM
- CUDA installed
- PyTorch with CUDA support

**For CPU (Slower):**

---

## üß™ **TESTING**

### **Test 1: Load Model**

```bash
# Check current status
curl http://localhost:8000/chatbot/status

# Load UserLM-8b model
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chatbot/load

# Wait ~1-2 minutes for model to load
# Check status again
curl http://localhost:8000/chatbot/status
```

Expected response after loading:
```json
{
  "loaded": true,
  "model": "microsoft/UserLM-8b",
  "status": "ready"
}
```

### **Test 2: Ask Complex Questions**

```bash
# Simple question
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chatbot/message?message=How%20many%20workers%20do%20we%20have"

# Complex question
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chatbot/message?message=Who%20are%20our%20top%20performers%20and%20what%20makes%20them%20effective"

# Analytical question
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/chatbot/message?message=Which%20workers%20should%20I%20avoid%20assigning%20to%20difficult%20tasks%20right%20now"
```

### **Test 3: Web Interface**

1. Open web app
2. Click blue chatbot icon
3. Ask: "Analyze our workforce and tell me who needs rest"
4. Should get detailed response with specific worker names and recommendations

---

## üìä **EXAMPLE CONVERSATIONS**

### **Example 1: Detailed Analysis**

**User:** "Analyze our workforce and tell me which workers are at risk of burnout"

**UserLM-8b Response:**
> Based on the current workforce data, I've identified 3 workers with high fatigue levels (‚â•70%) who are at risk of burnout. These workers should be assigned lighter tasks or given rest:
>
> 1. Worker [Name] - 75% fatigue, currently working 42.5 hours/week
> 2. Worker [Name] - 72% fatigue, 8.5 hours/day average
> 3. Worker [Name] - 70% fatigue, assigned to high-difficulty roles
>
> I recommend rotating these workers to less demanding tasks and monitoring their health metrics closely. In contrast, we have 35 workers with low fatigue (<30%) who are ready for challenging assignments.

### **Example 2: Performance Insights**

**User:** "Who should I assign to the most critical tasks?"

**UserLM-8b Response:**
> For critical tasks, I recommend our top 5 performers who have both high performance scores and low fatigue:
>
> 1. Priya Sharma - 92% performance, 20% fatigue, 8 years experience
> 2. Neha Gupta - 91% performance, 18% fatigue, 4.5 years experience
> 3. Sunita Reddy - 90% performance, 15% fatigue, 3.5 years experience
>
> These workers have proven track records with an average success rate of 89% on assignments. They also have the appropriate skill sets for complex roles and are currently in optimal condition to take on challenging work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **CONFIGURATION OPTIONS**

### **Adjust Response Length:**

In `chatbot.py`, line 166:
```python
max_new_tokens=300  # Increase for longer responses (default: 300)
```

### **Adjust Creativity:**

```python
temperature=1  # Higher = more creative (0.7-1.2 recommended)
top_p=0.8     # Higher = more diverse (0.8-0.95 recommended)
```

### **Enable GPU:**

Model automatically uses CUDA if available. Check with:
```python
print(f"Using device: {chatbot.device}")  # Should print "cuda"
```
