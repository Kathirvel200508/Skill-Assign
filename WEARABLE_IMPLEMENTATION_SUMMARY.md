# ✅ WEARABLE DEVICE INTEGRATION - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **1. Backend Database Models** (`backend/models.py`)

#### **HealthMetric Model**
Stores real-time health data from wearable devices:
- Heart rate (bpm)
- Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)
- Oxygen level (SpO2 %)
- Body temperature (°C)
- Stress level (0-100 scale)
- Fatigue score (0-100 scale)
- Daily steps count
- Calories burned
- Hours worked today
- Device ID (wearable device identifier)
- Timestamp

#### **WorkSession Model**
Tracks worker clock-in/out and hours worked:
- Worker ID
- Clock-in time
- Clock-out time
- Total hours worked
- Break duration
- Work location/station
- Linked task (optional)
- Device ID
- Recorded by (wearable device or manual)

---

### **2. API Schemas** (`backend/schemas.py`)

Created comprehensive Pydantic schemas for:
- `HealthMetricCreate` - Submit health data
- `HealthMetricResponse` - Return health data
- `WorkerHealthSummary` - Comprehensive health overview
- `WorkSessionCreate` - Clock in
- `WorkSessionUpdate` - Clock out
- `WorkSessionResponse` - Session details
- `WorkerHoursReport` - Hours worked report

---

### **3. REST API Endpoints** (`backend/main.py`)

#### **Health Monitoring Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/health/metric` | Receive health data from wearable |
| GET | `/health/worker/{id}` | Get worker health history |
| GET | `/health/worker/{id}/latest` | Get latest health reading |
| GET | `/health/worker/{id}/summary` | Get comprehensive health summary |
| GET | `/health/dashboard` | Get health dashboard for all workers |

#### **Work Hours Tracking Endpoints:**

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/session/clock-in` | Worker clocks in |
| PUT | `/session/{id}/clock-out` | Worker clocks out |
| GET | `/session/worker/{id}` | Get worker sessions |
| GET | `/session/worker/{id}/active` | Get active session |
| GET | `/session/worker/{id}/hours` | Get hours worked report |
| GET | `/session/all/hours` | Get all workers hours dashboard |

## 📊 Key Features

### **1. Real-Time Health Monitoring**

Supervisors can monitor:
- Current vital signs (heart rate, oxygen, temperature)
- Stress and fatigue levels
- Health status classification (Good/Warning/Critical)
- Automatic alerts for concerning metrics

**Alert Triggers:**
- ❗ Heart rate > 100 bpm
- ❗ Oxygen level < 95%
- ❗ Stress level > 70
- ❗ Fatigue score > 70
- 🚨 Body temperature > 38°C or < 36°C (Critical)

---

### **2. Intelligent Hours Tracking**

Automatic tracking of:
- Daily hours worked
- Weekly hours worked
- Monthly hours worked
- Overtime calculation (> 40 hours/week)
- Break duration
- Average session length
- Work location

**Status Classification:**
- ✅ **Normal:** < 40 hours/week
- ⚠️ **Approaching Limit:** 40-45 hours/week
- 🚨 **Overtime:** > 45 hours/week

---

### **3. Supervisor Dashboard**

Two comprehensive dashboards:

#### **Health Dashboard** (`/health/dashboard`)
Shows for all workers:
- Total workers monitored
- Workers in critical condition
- Workers with warnings
- Workers in good health
- Workers with alerts
- Average hours worked today
- Average hours worked this week

#### **Hours Dashboard** (`/session/all/hours`)
Shows for all workers:
- Today's hours
- This week's hours
- This month's hours
- Overtime hours
- Number of sessions
- Average session length
- Status (Normal/Approaching Limit/Overtime)

---

### **4. Worker-Level Details**

For each individual worker, supervisors can see:
- Complete health metric history
- Latest vital signs
- Health status and active alerts
- Work session history
- Active session (if currently working)
- Detailed hours report (daily/weekly/monthly)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

  - oxygen_level
  - body_temperature
  - stress_level
  - fatigue_score
  - steps_count
  - calories_burned
  - hours_worked_today
  - device_id
  - recorded_at (timestamp)

-- Work Sessions Table
work_sessions:
  - id (primary key)
  - worker_id (foreign key)
  - clock_in (timestamp)
  - clock_out (timestamp)
  - total_hours
  - break_duration
  - location
  - task_id (optional foreign key)
  - recorded_by
  - created_at (timestamp)
```
